Automated tool for scraping job postings into a `.csv` file.

### Benefits over job search sites:

* Never see the same job twice!
* No advertising.
* See jobs from multiple job search websites all in one place.
* Compare job search results between locations, and queries.

# Installation

_JobFunnel requires [Python][python] 3.8 or later._

```
pip install git+https://github.com/PaulMcInnis/JobFunnel.git
```

# Usage
By performing regular scraping and reviewing, you can cut through the noise of even the busiest job markets.

## Configure
You can search for jobs with YAML configuration files or by passing command arguments.

Get started by customizing our demo [settings.yaml][demo_yaml] to suit your needs (or just run it as-is):
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaulMcInnis/JobFunnel/master/demo/settings.yaml -O my_settings.yaml
```
_NOTE:_
* _It is recommended to provide as few search keywords as possible (i.e. `Python`, `AI`)._

* _JobFunnel currently only supports `CANADA_ENGLISH` and `USA_ENGLISH` locales._

## Scrape

Run `funnel` to populate your master CSV file with jobs from available providers:

```
funnel load -s my_settings.yaml
```

## Review

Open the master CSV file and update the per-job `status`:

* Set to `interested`, `applied`, `interview` or `offer` to reflect your progression on the job.

* Set to `archive`, `rejected` or `delete` to remove a job from this search. You can review 'blocked' jobs within your `block_list_file`.

# Advanced Usage

* **Automating Searches** <br />
  JobFunnel can be easily automated to run nightly with [crontab][cron] <br />
  For more information see the [crontab document][cron_doc].

* **Writing your own Scrapers** <br />
  If you have a job website you'd like to write a scraper for, you are welcome to implement it, Review the [Base Scraper][basescraper] for implementation details.

* **Adding Support for X Language / Job Website** <br />
  JobFunnel supports scraping jobs from the same job website across locales & domains. If you are interested in adding support, you may only need to define session headers and domain strings, Review the [Base Scraper][basescraper] for further implementation details.

* **Blocking Companies** <br />
  Filter undesired companies by adding them to your `company_block_list` in your YAML or pass them by command line as `-cbl`.

* **Job Age Filter** <br />
  You can configure the maximum age of scraped listings (in days) by configuring `max_listing_days`.

* **Reviewing Jobs in Terminal** <br />
  You can review the job list in the command line:
  ```
  column -s, -t < master_list.csv | less -#2 -N -S
  ```

* **Respectful Delaying** <br />
  Respectfully scrape your job posts with our built-in delaying algorithms.

  To better understand how to configure delaying, check out [this Jupyter Notebook][delay_jp] which breaks down the algorithm step by step with code and visualizations.

* **Recovering Lost Data** <br />
  JobFunnel can re-build your master CSV from your `cache_folder` where all the historic scrape data is located:
  ```
  funnel --recover
  ```

* **Running by CLI** <br />
  You can run JobFunnel using CLI only, review the command structure via:
  ```
  funnel inline -h
  ```
