[![Code Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/PaulMcInnis/JobFunnel/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/PaulMcInnis/JobFunnel)

Automated tool for scraping job postings into a `.csv` file.

_[Since this project was developed, CAPTCHA has clamped down hard, help us re-build the backend and make this tool useful again!](https://github.com/PaulMcInnis/JobFunnel/discussions/148)_

### Benefits over job search sites:

- Never see the same job twice!
- No advertising.
- See jobs from multiple job search websites all in one place.

# Installation

_JobFunnel requires [Python][python] 3.8 or later._

```
pip install git+https://github.com/PaulMcInnis/JobFunnel.git
```

# Usage

By performing regular scraping and reviewing, you can cut through the noise of
even the busiest job markets.

## Configure

You can search for jobs with YAML configuration files or by passing command
arguments.

Download the demo [settings.yaml][demo_yaml] by running the below command:

```
wget https://git.io/JUWeP -O my_settings.yaml
```

_NOTE:_

- _It is recommended to provide as few search keywords as possible (i.e.
  `Python`, `AI`)._

- _JobFunnel currently supports `CANADA_ENGLISH`, `USA_ENGLISH`, `UK_ENGLISH`,
  `FRANCE_FRENCH`, and `GERMANY_GERMAN` locales._

## Scrape

Run `funnel` with your settings YAML to populate your master CSV file with jobs
from available providers:

```
funnel load -s my_settings.yaml
```

## Review

Open the master CSV file and update the per-job `status`:

- Set to `interested`, `applied`, `interview` or `offer` to reflect your
  progression on the job.

- Set to `archive`, `rejected` or `delete` to remove a job from this search. You
  can review 'blocked' jobs within your `block_list_file`.

# Advanced Usage

- **Automating Searches** <br /> JobFunnel can be easily automated to run
  nightly with [crontab][cron] <br /> For more information see the [crontab
  document][cron_doc].

- **Writing your own Scrapers** <br /> If you have a job website you'd like to
  write a scraper for, you are welcome to implement it, Review the [Base
  Scraper][basescraper] for implementation details.

- **Remote Work** <br /> Bypass a frustrating user experience looking for remote
  work by setting the search parameter `remoteness` to match your desired level,
  i.e. `FULLY_REMOTE`.

- **Adding Support for X Language / Job Website** <br /> JobFunnel supports
  scraping jobs from the same job website across locales & domains. If you are
  interested in adding support, you may only need to define session headers and
  domain strings, Review the [Base Scraper][basescraper] for further
  implementation details.

- **Blocking Companies** <br /> Filter undesired companies by adding them to
  your `company_block_list` in your YAML or pass them by command line as `-cbl`.

- **Job Age Filter** <br /> You can configure the maximum age of scraped
  listings (in days) by configuring `max_listing_days`.

- **Reviewing Jobs in Terminal** <br /> You can review the job list in the
  command line:

  ```
  column -s, -t < master_list.csv | less -#2 -N -S
  ```

- **Respectful Delaying** <br /> Respectfully scrape your job posts with our
  built-in delaying algorithms.

  To better understand how to configure delaying, check out [this Jupyter
  Notebook][delay_jp] which breaks down the algorithm step by step with code and
  visualizations.

- **Recovering Lost Data** <br /> JobFunnel can re-build your master CSV from
  your `cache_folder` where all the historic scrape data is located:

  ```
  funnel --recover
  ```

- **Running by CLI** <br /> You can run JobFunnel using CLI only, review the
  command structure via:
  ```
  funnel inline -h
  ```

# CAPTCHA

JobFunnel does not solve CAPTCHA. If, while scraping, you receive a
`Unable to extract jobs from initial search result page:\` error. Then open that
url on your browser and solve the CAPTCHA manually.
