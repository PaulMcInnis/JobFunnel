# JobPy

Automated tool for scraping job postings to a `.csv` file.

### Benefits over job search sites:

* never see the same job twice!
* browse all search results at once, in an easy to read/sort spreadsheet
* keep track of all explicitly new job postings in your area
* see jobs from multiple job search sites all in one place

The spreadsheet for managing your job search:

### Installing JobPy

```
git clone https://github.com/PaulMcInnis/JobPy.git
pip install -e JobPy
jobpy --help
```

### Using JobPy

1. Set your job search preferences in `jobpy/config/search_terms.json` (or use `-kw`)
1. Run `jobpy` to scrape all-available job listings
1. Review jobs in `jobs_masterlist.csv`, set any undesired jobs `status` to `archive`, these jobs will be removed from `.csv` next time you run `jobpy`
1. If you get an `interview`/`offer` or are `rejected`, update the job `status`, note that `rejected` jobs will be filtered out and will disappear from the output `.csv`

### Usage Notes
* note that any custom states (i.e `applied`) are preserved in the spreadsheet
* to update active filters and to see any `new` jobs going forwards, just run `jobpy` again, and review the `.csv` file
* you can keep multiple search results across multiple `.csv` files: i.e: `jobpy -kw Python -o data/python_masterlist.csv` for python jobs, and `jobpy -kw AI Machine Learning -o data/ML_masterlist.csv` for ML jobs
* by adding job undesired i.e. consulting companies to the `config/blacklist.json`, you can exclude them from results
* system is easily automated to run nightly with crontab
