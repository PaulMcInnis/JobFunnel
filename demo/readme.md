To try this demo simply open a terminal on this folder and type:

funnel -s settings.yaml
```

Feel free to copy the settings file to configure your own job searches. If installed via `pip`, the `funnel` command can be called from any folder in your system.

__*Note*__: JobFunnel works best on Linux. It has not been tested on other operating systems. Get in touch with the developers if you would like to maintain macOS or Windows support.
